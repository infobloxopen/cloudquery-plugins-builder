# Specification Quality Checklist: Use Infoblox Fork of CloudQuery

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-003 and FR-004 explicitly call out what must NOT change, which is critical for this migration.
- The spec correctly identifies that `ldflags_version_path` values are Go module paths and must be preserved.
- Scripts (`build.sh`, `validate-manifest.sh`) were confirmed via code review to have no hardcoded upstream URLs — they read dynamically from the manifest.
